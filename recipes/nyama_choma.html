    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The name comprises of two words; nyama which means meat and choma which means barbecued in English. Put the two words together and you have barbecued meat. It is a popular dish in East Africa, especially in Kenya and Tanzania. Normally, beef, pork, mutton, or goat meat are used.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Chilli</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Paprika powder</li>
        <li>Goat leg or preferred cut of meat</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>For the nyama choma marinade, blend all ingredients (except the meat) until smooth. If you lack a blender, dice everything finely or use a pestle and mortar. Marinating the meat is an extra step, but it's worth it as it enhances the flavors.</li>
        <li>On a chopping board, make 2-inch (5 cm) slits on the meat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, coat the meat with the marinade, ensuring the slits are covered. Save some marinade for basting during grilling.</li>
        <li>Cover the meat and allow it to marinate for at least two hours or overnight, for best results .</li>
        <li>Bring meat to room temperature. Preheat the grill to high; if using charcoal, adjust the heat using the ashes.</li>
        <li>Sear meat for 3 minutes per side to get char marks. Place on oiled foil and top with the reserved marinade. Add garlic and rosemary on top, then cover losely with foil.</li>
        <li>Set meat on a water-filled tray and grill under medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>As an optional step, near the end, mix honey and hot water and glaze the meat with it. Continue grilling until cooked through, and the juices run clear.</li>
        <li>Let the meat rest for 10-20 minutes and then serve.</li>
    </ol>
